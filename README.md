Morse code is a method of encoding textual information through a series of dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`) that represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. It was designed to be transmitted via sound, light, or visual signals, making it incredibly useful in situations where verbal communication isn’t feasible—such as over long distances or in emergencies.

Historical Background
Morse code was developed in the early 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail as part of the invention of the telegraph system. It revolutionized long-distance communication by enabling instant message transmission over wires using electrical impulses. Its original purpose was to facilitate communication between telegraph operators before voice transmission was possible.

The first Morse code message—“What hath God wrought?”—was sent on May 24, 1844, between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.

How Morse Code Works
Each character in Morse code is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes:
- A dot (.) is a short signal
- A dash (-) is a longer signal

For example:
- A = `.-`
- B = `-...`
- C = `-.-.`

Characters are separated by spaces, and words are divided by slashes (`/`). Morse code can be transmitted using light (flashes), sound (beeps), or physical signals (taps), making it versatile across various mediums.
